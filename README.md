# MultiPar

### v1.3.3.5 is public

&nbsp; This is a minor update version. 
If there is no serious problem in this version, 
next version will be the last of v1.3.3 tree.

&nbsp; It's difficult to support multi-monitor of different DPI. 
Thanks [kwinz for reporting this problem](https://github.com/Yutaka-Sawada/MultiPar/issues/146). 
Though I could not solve blurry window on multi-monitor case, users can see what it is.

&nbsp; I added an optional feature to set max size of recovery files directly.
For details, refer `Command_GUI.txt` and `Command_par2j.txt` in `help` folder of MultiPar.

&nbsp; My web-pages on `vector.co.jp` disappered at 2024 December 20. 
Thanks Vector to support MultiPar for long time. 
I use [this GitHub page](https://github.com/Yutaka-Sawada/MultiPar) for MultiPar announcement.
