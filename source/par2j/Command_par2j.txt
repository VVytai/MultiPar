[ Usage description ]

key input :
 Push "c" key if you want to cancel process.
 Push "p" / "r" key if you want to pasue / resume process.

exit code (bit-wise OR) :
  0 = normal end
  1 = fatal error
  2 = cancel by c-key
  4 = input files are incomplete
  8 | 4 = need more blocks to repair
 16 = repair succeeded
 16 | 4 = repair failed
 32 | 4 = rename, move, and/or restore is possible
 64 | 4 = rejoin and/or reconstruct is possible
128 | 4 = repair is possible
128 | 8 | 4 = repair may be possible
256 = PAR files are incomplete

specifying <par file> :
 <par file> is either absolute path or relative path from current directory.
Note, it is not relative path from the PAR client's directory.

trial :
 You do trial construction of PAR recovery files.
You can test how many or how large those files with your settings.
This is much faster than create command.

create :
 You create PAR recovery files.
To specify PAR files, <par file> cannot contain "*" or "?".
If you create multiple PAR files like "sample.par2, sample.vol0+1.par2, sample.vol1+2.par2",
set base filename. Normaly it is same as filename of index file. (sample.par2)
The default extension (.par2) is appended automatically, unless it exists.

 You can write multiple input files in command line.
The order of files in a recovery set is different from this command order.
If you don't set [input files], the filename of <par file> without extension
will be used as a single input file.
You cannot supply input files of same filename as the creating PAR files.

 All input files must have same base-directory (root).
This directory can be set by /d option, or directory of <par file> is used.
Though it is possible to input with absolute path,
[input files] are set as relative path from the base-directory.
A short filename in a path will be converted to long filename.

 [input files] can contain "*" or "?" for search.
"*" is treated as multiple unknown characters.
"?" is treated as single unknown character.
If it is "*", all files in the specified directory are searched.
If these are "*.txt" and "*.doc", files with extensions ".txt" and ".doc"
in the specified directory are searched.
When you don't see hidden files on Windows Explorer, they are ignored by search.
If you want to search hidden files, change Windows Explorer setting to see them.

 [input files] can be folder, too.
If it is "folder_name", files in the folder are searched also.
(This is same as "folder_name/*".)
If it is "folder_name/", files in the folder are not searched.

verify :
 You check files in a recovery set.
If some files are damaged or missing, this show how many slices are available.

 If you have multiple PAR files, specifying whichever filename is possible,
but setting base filename (or filename of the smallest file) is preferable,
because the selected file is scanned at first.
For when the specified PAR file does not exist,
<par file> may contain "*" or "?" with partial filename to search another PAR file.

 You may specify external files, which are outside of par/input file's directory.
[external files] can be both par file and input file.
Though it is possible to add files by searching with "*" or "?",
folders (and files in sub-folders) are ignored.
Though relative path from current directory is possible, abusolute path is safe.

repair :
 You check and reapir files in a recovery set.
This makes temporary files while check, so slower than verify only.
If you want to check only, use verify command.

list :
 You see what files are included in a recovery set.
This does not check files, so run very fast.
This may work, even if recovery files are damaged or not enough.


[ Option description ]

 Every options must start with prefix "/" or "-".
If you use either one at first option, you must use it at all following options.
It means that it is impossible to mix "/" and "-" in options of same command line.
If PAR file's filename (or relative path) is started by "-",
you need to use "/" for prefix of options to distinguish PAR file.

 When a option has arbitary number or text,
don't put space between the option and following part.
For example, setting "/rr10" is valid, but "/rr 10" is wrong.
Setting "/dPath" is valid, but "/d Path" is wrong.

 To distinguish options from filenames, order of command-line arguments is important.
Put all options before <par file>.
Put <par file> before all [input files] or [external files].


 /f, /fu :
 Set this, if you use file-list for file name or file path.
When this option is set, [input files] or [external files] is path of file-list.
The file-list is a text file, which contains filenames in each line.
If you encode filename in the list by UTF-8, set /fu instead of /f.

 /fo :
 Set this, if you want to ignore folders at wildcard matching search.
This setting disable recursive search into sub-folders also.
Note, sub-directory of each input file is still possible.
At verification, this disables searching misnamed files in sub-folders.

 /fa or /fe :
 Set this, if you want to exclude files at wildcard matching search.
When this option is set, [input file] is "*" normally.
The format to allow is /fa"sub-directory and/or filename with * or ?".
The format to deny is /fe"sub-directory and/or filename with * or ?".
The path must be a relative from base-directory.
"**" replesents any characters.
"*" replesents any characters except directory separator.
"?" replesents a single character except directory separator.

 While you may set this option multiple times to exclude some types,
the total length of the exclusion list is limited to 8000 characters.
When one or more allow-options are set,
files which don't match all of them are excluded.
When one or more deny-options are set,
files which match one of them are excluded.
When a file matches both option, deny-option is prior.

 The ending character will change search behavior as following;
"abc" matches a file which name is "abc".
"abc/" matches an empty folder which name is "abc".
"abc/*" matches "abc" folder and inner files direct under the folder.
"abc/**" matches "abc" folder and all inner files and folders recursively.

 for example;
/fa"**.zip" to add all .ZIP files in all folders recursively.
/fe"**.par2" to exclude all PAR2 files in all folders recursively.
/fe"*.bat" to exclude .BAT files in base-directory.
/fe"folder1/**" to exclude folder1 and inner files recursively.
/fe"*/*.tmp" to exclude .TMP files in sub-folders.
/fe"**/" to exclude all empty folders recursively.

 /ss :
 This is Input File Slice size.
This must be a multiple of 4 under 2 GB in this application.
But, this is good to be multiple of 16 for speed.
For compatibility, it's good to set less than 100,000,000 bytes (95 MB).
If /sn is set with this,
the number of source blocks will be limited up to the value.
If /sm is set with this,
size will be adjusted (from -25% to +50%) for better efficiency.
(the range of count is from -33% to +33%.)

 for example, "/ss262144 /sn3000 /sm2048" will try the size from 192 KB
to 384 KB for each 2 KB, or the count will be limited up to 3000 blocks.

 /sn :
 This is the number of source blocks.
This is not an exact number.
Because the Slice size is a multiple of 4,
the actual number of source blocks will be different slightly.
The number will be adjusted (from -12.5% to +6.25%) for better efficiency.
32768 is the max number of source blocks.
If /ss or /sr is set with this,
the number of source blocks will be limited up to this value.

 /sr :
 Source block count divided by block size is the rate.
If the value is 10, source block count becomes 1% of block size.
The range is from 1 (0.1%) to 1023 (102%).
The rate will be adjusted (from -0.09% to +0.09%) for better efficiency.
If /sn is set with this,
the number of source blocks will be limited up to the value.
When all options (/ss, /sn and /sr) are not set,
"/sr10 /sn3000" is used as default setting.

 for example, "/sr10 /sn3000" will try the rate from 0.91% to 1.09%,
or the count will be limited up to 3000 blocks.

 /sm :
 If this is set, Slice size becomes a multiple of this value.
You may set a cluster size of HDD/CD/DVD or UseNet article size.
The value must be a multiple of 4 and the max is 4194300. (2^22-4)

 for example, /sm2048 , /sm4096 , /sm384000

 /rr :
 Redundancy can be from 0.01% to 1000%.
It accepts the rate value to two decimal places.
The recognized decimal point character is either "." or ",".
It is possible to set either /rr, /rn, or /rp.
When these options are not set, recovery block is not made.

 for example,  /rr10 , /rr30 , /rr100 , /rr0.5 , /rr3.14

 /rn :
 Set number of recovery blocks directly.
For the convenience, 65535 is the max number of recovery blocks.
(overt than 65536th block is worthless, as its recovery data is same as previous.)
It is possible to set either /rr, /rn, or /rp.
When these options are not set, recovery block is not made.

 for example,  /rn10 , /rn1024 , /rn2000

 /rp :
 Set number of possible recovered files, even when they are totally lost.
This is useful to make minimum recovery files to recover a few source files.
It sets parity blocks to be sum of source blocks on larger source files.
The value may have a decimal place to set extra redundancy.
The format is "/rp[files].[redundancy]", and the max value is "/rp999.99".
The recognized decimal point character is either "." or ",".
It is possible to set either /rr, /rn, or /rp.
When these options are not set, recovery block is not made.

 for example,  /rp1 , /rp2 , /rp1.05 , /rp2.1

 /rs :
 Set starting number of recovery blocks.
For example, when 100 recovery blocks are on creating,
the number of created recovery blocks are from 100 to 199 for /rs100,
and from 1000 to 1099 for /rs1000.
Default is 0, and from 0 to 99 are created as 100 recovery blocks.

 /rd :
 How to put recovery blocks in recovery files.
/rd0 = default, all the same amount. Put all in a file, if /rf nor /lr are not set.
/rd1 = variable different amount. /lr is ignored.
/rd2 = powers of two sizing scheme. /rf is ignored.
/rd3 = decimal weights sizing scheme by persicum. /rf is ignored.

 /rf :
 Set how many recovery files you want to create.
(index file is not included in this number.)
This option is available with /rd0 or /rd1.
When both /rf and /lr are set, /lr is prior to /rf, and more recovery files may be created.
When neither are not set, it's automatically set by number of input files and redundancy.

 /ri :
 By setting this, file index is used to name recovery files.
Normaly, number of recovery blocks is used like ".volXX+YY" as volume index.
It becomes ".vol_ZZ" by this option.
If you create same size recovery files, or don't care how many blocks,
this simple numbering scheme may be good.
When it is important to know how many blocks, don't use this option.

 /lr :
 Set this limit, if you want to set max size of recovery files.
This is the max number of blocks in a file, not max size of file itself.
Because it may be difficult to predict recovery file size,
use trial command to see how is the size.
When it's "/lr" or "/lr0", block count of the largest input file is used.
(If the max file is 1000 KB and block size is 10 KB, /lr is same as /lr100.)
When both "/lr0" and "/ls(split size)" are set,
block count of the splited file size is used instead of the largest input file.

 for example,  /lr , /lr10 , /lr2000

 /lp :
 Set this limit, if you want smaller recovery file.
Normaly log2+1 of recovery block count is used for packet repetition.
block count     0 to     1 ->  once
block count     2 to     3 ->  twice
block count     4 to     7 ->  3 times
block count     8 to    15 ->  4 times
block count    16 to    31 ->  5 times
block count    32 to    63 ->  6 times
block count    64 to   127 ->  7 times
block count   128 to   255 ->  8 times
block count   256 to   511 ->  9 times
block count   512 to  1023 -> 10 times
block count  1024 to  2047 -> 11 times
block count  2048 to  4095 -> 12 times
block count  4096 to  8191 -> 13 times
block count  8192 to 16383 -> 14 times
block count 16384 to 32767 -> 15 times
block count 32768 to 65535 -> 16 times

If you create some recovery files, 
packet repetition in a file can be smaller, may be 4 is enough.
Max limit value is 7.
/lp is same as /lp4 option.

 for example,  /lp2 , /lp4 , /lp7

 /ls :
 The spliting feature doesn't belong to PAR spec, just for utility.
It will split input files after create recovery files,
and save them in the directory of recovery files.
This splitting is enabled, only when there is no sub-directory nor folder.
Split size must be lower than 4 GB.
Split size will become multiple of slice size automatically.
If you set 10000 and slice size is 3000, the split size will be 9000.
If a file is smaller than the split size, it will be copied simply.

 The original files are not deleted after split.
Splited file pieces have additional incremental number extension,
like ".001", ".002", ".003", ,,, , ".999"
Other small copied files don't have extra extension.

 /ls1 has a special feature of appending recovery record to an archive file.
This is possible, only when there is one input file of .ZIP or .7z format.
When recovery files are created in a different directory,
the protected archive file is made in the directory.

 /ls2 has a special feature to set limit size of recovery files directly.
When both "/ls2" and "/lr(limit size)" are set,
setting number of /lr is recognizned as file size instead of number of blocks.
In this usage, setting limit size must be less than 2 GB.
If you want max 100 MB each file size, set like these; /ls2 /lr102400000
Because the calculation ignores packets, you may set a bit smaller size.

 for example,  /ls10000 , /ls1048576, /ls1

 /lc :
 Set this, if you want to set number of using threads for Multi-Core CPU,
or want to disable extra feature. (SSE2 is always used.)
The format is "/lc#" (# is from 1 to 32 as the number of using threads).

 It's possible to set by rate as following. (It's /lc0 by default.)
251: It uses quarter number of physical Cores.
252: It uses half of physical Cores.
253: It uses 3/4 number of physical Cores.
254: It uses one less threads than number of physical Cores.
  0: It uses the number of physical Cores.
255: It tries to use more threads than number of physical Cores.

 You may set additional combinations for CPU feature;
+1024 to disable CLMUL (and use slower SSSE3 code)
+2048 to disable JIT (for SSE2)
+4096 to disable SSSE3
+8192 to disable AVX2

 You may set additional combinations for GPU control;
+256 or +512 (slower device) to enable GPU acceleration
+65536 for classic method
+131072 for 16-byte memory access
+262144 for 4-byte memory access and calculate 2 blocks at once
+524288 for 16-byte memory access and calculate 2 blocks at once
+1048576 for CL_MEM_COPY_HOST_PTR or +2097152 for CL_MEM_USE_HOST_PTR
(When you set exclusive bits, larger value will be used.)

 for example,  /lc1 to use single Core, /lc508 to use half Cores and GPU

 /lcb :
 This is for Cache Blocking. (CPU cache optimization)
By default, this value is set-associative size of CPU L2 cache.
Maximum value is 32767. It will be multipled by 64 KB.
To disable cache optimization, set "/lcb0".

 /lcs :
 This is for large buffer size at calculating multiple files' hashes.
By default, this value is set-associative size of CPU L3 cache.
Maximum value is 65535. It will be multipled by 64 KB.
When you set "/lcs0", large buffer size will become 2 MB by default.

 /lcm :
 This is for max number of chunks to calculate at once. (CPU shared cache optimization)
By default, this value may be rate of L3 cache size / L2 cache size.
The value may be changed by some factors in experimental results.
Maximum value is 32768. Lower values than 8 will be same as 32768.
To disable cache optimization, set "/lcm0".

 /m :
 Set this, if you want to set memory usage.
If too many memory is allocated, system will use swap file.
Because swap causes serious speed down, limiting memory usage may useful.
The value is from 1 to 7. (from 1/8 to 7/8)
It is a rate against the PC's available physical memory. (not total memory)
If this is not set or the value is 0, the rate depends on free memory.
/m0 = Auto is default (between 6/8 and 7/8 mostly)
/m1 = 1/8, 12.5%
/m4 = 4/8, 50%
/m7 = 7/8, 87.5%

 For debug usage, it's possible to switch file access mode.
+8  = Sequential scan mode for HDD (or Optical drive)
+16 = Random access mode for SSD (or RAM drive)
+32 = Multi-read more files on SSD (must set with +16)
Normally users should not set this, unless automatic selection has a problem.

 /vl :
 Set this, if you want faster or extra verification.
Default is detailed search but rarely slow.
If there is not enough memory for detailed search,
simple version will be used automatically.
In additional verification, all files in base directory are checked as input files,
and all par files in <par file>'s directory are checked.
/vl0 = detailed verification
/vl1 = simple verification
/vl2 = additional & detailed verification
/vl3 = additional & simple verification
/vl4 = aligned verification

 If you want to prevent making temporary files
and recover damaged source files directly,
set /vl4 for aligned verification and direct recovery.
When you set /vl4, external files are ignored.
Additional files and splited files are ignored, too.
All backup settings (/b /br /bi) are disabled.
Direct recovery will over write recovered blocks on damaged files.
There is a risk of failed repair, and loss of damaged files.

 /vs :
 Set this, if you want to save a current verification result
and/or re-use a previous verification results.
This feature is disabled by default. (same as /vs0)
If you want to disable this feature, set 0.
If you want to re-use a result of recent verification, set value from 1 to 7.
Old data files are erased, when there is no update for the specified period.
(1= 1 day, 2= 3 days, 3= 1 week, 4= half month, 5= 1 month, 6= 1 year, 7= unlimited)
If you want to newly create a result of this time, add 8 to period.

 One recent verification result data is saved as 2 files, "2_***.bin" and "2_***.ini".
*** part depends on Recovery Set ID.
Don't modify these files, or corrupted data will make failure.

 /vd :
 If you want to save recent verification results in a different directory
from the PAR client's directory, use this setting to set path.

 /c :
 Comment may be useful for memo ?
If you include space in comment, use "" to specify where is end.

 for example, /csomething , /c"something important data."

 /d :
 If input files exist in a different directory from PAR file,
use this setting to set the path as base-directory.
This is either absolute path or relative path from current directory.
If you include space in path, use "" to specify where is end.
As you may omit the last "/" in path of a folder,
both "/dC:/data/" and "/dC:/data" are valid.
Note, setting "/dD:" is same as setting current directory of D-drive.
If you want to set direct root of D-drive, you must set "/dD:/".

 for example, /dC:/data/ , /d"C:/Program Files/" , /d../data/

 When this is not set, the directory of PAR file is used.
If input files are specified with absolute path in command-line,
the parent directory of the first input file is used.

 If damaged files exist in read-only media like CR-ROM or DVD-ROM,
copy all files to HDD at first, then repair those damaged files.

 /in :
 Set this, if do not you want to create an Index File.
This is ignored, when recovery files are not created.

 /up :
 This may be good for non-ASCII filename.
This is helpful only when the PAR2 client supports Unicode Filename packet.
Normally this option is worthless, because most clients don't recognize it.

 /uo :
 This setting is useful to show filename of non-supported language.
You may decode the UTF-8 encoded output with Internet Browser.

 /w :
 If you want to save verification result on a JSON file, set this.
The filename is the selected PAR file with ".json" extension.
You may change the saved directory by /vd option.

"SelectedFile" and other items with directory:
To omit escape sequence in JSON, directory mark is replaced from \ to /.

"RecoveryFile":
Useless files aren't listed.
External files are distinguishable by directory mark /.

"MisnamedFile":
Names are stored in a set of "Correct name":"Wrong name".

 /p :
 If you want to remove recovery files after verification or repair, set this.
Only when all input files are complete, this will purge recovery files.
It tries to send recovery files to recycle bin always.
When recycle bin isn't available like USB memory, it will just delete them.
Be careful to set this option.

 /b :
 If you want to make backup at repair, set this.
This is important setting, because this application may contain bugs.
The existing damaged file is renamed by adding number extension like ".1" or ".2".

 /br :
 This is almost same as /b option.
The backup file is sent to recycle bin instead of the original directory.
When path of a damaged file is too long, this works as same as /b above.

 /bi :
 Set this, when you want partially reconstructed files by incomplete recovery.
It aligns found blocks in correct positions for each file,
even when repair is impossible or incomplete.
This option has a risk of further data loss,
because missing or damaged blocks are filled by zero bytes.
Then, it is safe to use this with /b or /br.

 /h :
 If you want to see hash of files in recovery file, use this.
You can compare yourself with other hash checking soft.
